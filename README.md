Learning ir compensation for dc motors

This project started out as an attempt to control a dc motor under variable load with constant speed and varying torque. The system included an Atmega328p microcontroller, Darlington pair driver and a low side current sense resistor. Only after observing dissappointing behavior I realized that while the system is unsuitable for maintaining constant speed under varying load.

Had this project been successful, this project would have been used in one of the pieces in the Slovenian Pavilion in Venice Biennale 2015.
